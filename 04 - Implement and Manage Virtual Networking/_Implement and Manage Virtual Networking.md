# Implement and manage virtual networking (15â€“20%)

### Objective Overview

Refer to individual objective pages for details:

- [[01 - Configure and manage virtual networks in Azure]]
- [[02 - Configure secure access to virtual networks]]
- [[03 - Configure name resolution and load balancing]]

---

### Key Concepts

- Network segmentation using VNets and subnets for isolation and security
- Hub-spoke network topology for centralized management and shared services
- Zero Trust security model with NSGs and private endpoints
- High availability through load balancing and multiple availability zones
- Hybrid connectivity options for on-premises integration

### Relevant Terms & Definitions

|Virtual Network (VNet)|Isolated network in Azure cloud|Home > Virtual networks|
|Subnet|IP address range within a VNet|VNet > Subnets|
|Network Security Group (NSG)|Firewall rules for network traffic|Home > Network security groups|

### Azure CLI Commands

```bash
# Virtual Network and Subnet
az network vnet create --resource-group MyRG --name MyVNet --address-prefixes 10.0.0.0/16
az network vnet subnet create --resource-group MyRG --vnet-name MyVNet --name MySubnet --address-prefixes 10.0.1.0/24

# VNet Peering
az network vnet peering create --resource-group MyRG --name VNet1ToVNet2 --vnet-name VNet1 --remote-vnet VNet2 --allow-vnet-access

# Network Security Group
az network nsg create --resource-group MyRG --name MyNSG
az network nsg rule create --resource-group MyRG --nsg-name MyNSG --name AllowSSH --priority 100 --source-address-prefixes Internet --destination-port-ranges 22 --access Allow --protocol Tcp

# Azure Bastion
az network bastion create --resource-group MyRG --name MyBastion --vnet-name MyVNet --public-ip-address MyBastionIP

# Load Balancer
az network lb create --resource-group MyRG --name MyLoadBalancer --sku Standard --public-ip-address MyPublicIP
```

### PowerShell Commands

```powershell
# Virtual Network and Subnet
$vnet = New-AzVirtualNetwork -ResourceGroupName MyRG -Name MyVNet -AddressPrefix 10.0.0.0/16 -Location eastus
Add-AzVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name MySubnet -AddressPrefix 10.0.1.0/24 -VirtualNetwork $vnet | Set-AzVirtualNetwork

# VNet Peering
Add-AzVirtualNetworkPeering -Name VNet1ToVNet2 -VirtualNetwork $vnet1 -RemoteVirtualNetworkId $vnet2.Id

# Network Security Group
$nsg = New-AzNetworkSecurityGroup -ResourceGroupName MyRG -Name MyNSG -Location eastus
$nsg | Add-AzNetworkSecurityRuleConfig -Name AllowRDP -Priority 100 -Access Allow -Protocol Tcp -Direction Inbound -SourceAddressPrefix Internet -SourcePortRange * -DestinationAddressPrefix * -DestinationPortRange 3389 | Set-AzNetworkSecurityGroup

# Load Balancer
$lb = New-AzLoadBalancer -ResourceGroupName MyRG -Name MyLoadBalancer -Location eastus -Sku Standard
```

### Cost Considerations

- VNet peering charges for data transfer between VNets (ingress free, egress charged)
- Azure Bastion pricing includes hourly charge plus data processing fees
- Standard Load Balancer has rule charges plus data processing costs
- Private endpoints incur hourly charges plus data processing fees
- NAT Gateway charges include hourly rate and data processing

### Security Best Practices

- Implement defense in depth with NSGs at both subnet and NIC levels
- Use Application Security Groups to simplify complex security rules
- Deploy Azure Bastion instead of public IPs for management access
- Prefer Private Endpoints over Service Endpoints for sensitive data
- Regular security rule audits and cleanup of unused rules

### Business Use Cases

- **Hub-spoke topology**: Centralized services with departmental VNets
- **Multi-tier applications**: Web, app, and database tiers in separate subnets
- **Hybrid connectivity**: Secure connection to on-premises networks
- **PaaS security**: Private connectivity to storage, SQL, and other services
- **High availability**: Load balanced applications across availability zones

### Real-World Analogies

- **VNet**: Private office building with controlled access
- **Subnet**: Different floors or departments within the building
- **NSG**: Security guards with specific access lists
- **Load Balancer**: Reception desk directing visitors to available staff
- **VNet Peering**: Private hallway between two office buildings

### Common Pitfalls & Misconceptions

- Forgetting that NSG rules are stateful (return traffic automatically allowed)
- Not understanding that VNet peering is non-transitive
- Assuming Basic Load Balancer supports availability zones (it doesn't)
- Overlooking that some resources require dedicated subnets (Bastion, Gateway)
- Confusing Service Endpoints (network path) with Private Endpoints (private IP)

### Things to Look Out for on the Exam

- Understand the difference between NSG priority numbers (lower = higher priority)
- Know which Azure services support Service Endpoints vs Private Endpoints
- Remember that Azure Bastion requires a specific subnet named 'AzureBastionSubnet'
- Standard Load Balancer is required for availability zones and cross-zone scenarios
- VNet peering must be configured in both directions for bidirectional communication
- Application Security Groups can only be used within the same VNet
- Default NSG rules cannot be deleted but can be overridden
- Know the address ranges reserved by Azure in each subnet (first 4 and last 1)
