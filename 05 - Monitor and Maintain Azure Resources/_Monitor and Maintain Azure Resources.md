#### Azure CLI Commands

```bash
# Azure Monitor - Create Log Analytics Workspace
az monitor log-analytics workspace create --resource-group MyRG --workspace-name MyWorkspace

# Create metric alert
az monitor metrics alert create --name MyAlert --resource-group MyRG --scopes /subscriptions/{SubID}/resourceGroups/{RG}/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/{VM} --condition "avg Percentage CPU > 80" --window-size 5m --evaluation-frequency 1m

# Query logs
az monitor log-analytics query --workspace MyWorkspace --analytics-query "AzureActivity | summarize count() by Category" --time-span P1D

# Create Recovery Services vault
az backup vault create --resource-group MyRG --name MyVault --location eastus

# Enable VM backup
az backup protection enable-for-vm --resource-group MyRG --vault-name MyVault --vm MyVM --policy-name DefaultPolicy

# Create Site Recovery vault
az site-recovery vault create --name MySRVault --resource-group MyRG --location eastus

# Network Watcher - Test connectivity
az network watcher test-connectivity --resource-group MyRG --source-resource MyVM1 --dest-resource MyVM2 --protocol TCP --dest-port 80
```

#### PowerShell Commands

```powershell
# Create Log Analytics Workspace
New-AzOperationalInsightsWorkspace -ResourceGroupName MyRG -Name MyWorkspace -Location eastus

# Create action group
New-AzActionGroup -Name MyActionGroup -ResourceGroupName MyRG -ShortName MyAG -Email @{Name="Admin";EmailAddress="admin@contoso.com"}

# Create metric alert
$condition = New-AzMetricAlertRuleV2Criteria -MetricName "Percentage CPU" -MetricNamespace "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines" -TimeAggregation Average -Operator GreaterThan -Threshold 80
Add-AzMetricAlertRuleV2 -Name MyAlert -ResourceGroupName MyRG -WindowSize 0:5 -Frequency 0:1 -TargetResourceId $vm.Id -Condition $condition -ActionGroupId $actionGroup.Id

# Create Recovery Services vault
New-AzRecoveryServicesVault -Name MyVault -ResourceGroupName MyRG -Location eastus

# Enable backup for VM
$vault = Get-AzRecoveryServicesVault -Name MyVault
Set-AzRecoveryServicesVaultContext -Vault $vault
$policy = Get-AzRecoveryServicesBackupProtectionPolicy -Name "DefaultPolicy"
Enable-AzRecoveryServicesBackupProtection -ResourceGroupName MyRG -Name MyVM -Policy $policy

# Network Watcher operations
$networkWatcher = Get-AzNetworkWatcher -ResourceGroupName NetworkWatcherRG
Test-AzNetworkWatcherConnectivity -NetworkWatcher $networkWatcher -SourceId $vm1.Id -DestinationId $vm2.Id -DestinationPort 80
```

#### Cost Considerations

- Log Analytics Workspace: Pay per GB ingested and retained
- Application Insights: Free tier available, then pay per GB
- Backup storage: LRS cheaper than GRS, pay per protected instance
- Site Recovery: Per protected instance per month
- Alert rules: Charges per rule evaluation and notifications sent

#### Security Best Practices

- Use managed identities for authentication when possible
- Implement RBAC for monitoring and backup operations
- Encrypt backup data at rest and in transit
- Use private endpoints for Recovery Services vaults
- Regularly review and audit alert configurations

#### Business Use Cases

- **VM Performance Monitoring**: CPU, memory, disk metrics with alerts
- **Application Monitoring**: Application Insights for web apps
- **Security Monitoring**: Activity logs for unauthorized access attempts
- **Disaster Recovery**: Site Recovery for critical workloads
- **Compliance**: Long-term backup retention for regulatory requirements

#### Real-World Analogies

- **Azure Monitor**: Security camera system recording everything
- **Metrics**: Speedometer showing current speed
- **Logs**: Detailed journey logbook
- **Alerts**: Smoke alarm triggering when threshold exceeded
- **Backup**: Safety deposit box for valuables

#### Common Pitfalls & Misconceptions

- Confusing metrics (numerical) with logs (text/events)
- Not understanding retention periods and costs
- Assuming backup automatically includes all data
- Forgetting to test restore procedures
- Not configuring alert suppression/action groups properly

#### Things to Look Out for on the Exam

- Know the difference between Recovery Services vault and Backup vault
- Understand KQL basics for log queries
- Remember metric retention is 93 days, logs are customizable
- Alert rule components: condition, action group, severity
- Site Recovery supports cross-region failover, Backup is for data recovery
- Network Watcher requires specific NSG flow log configuration
- Know which resources support which backup solutions
- Understand the difference between Connection Monitor v1 and v2

#### Practice Test Questions I Got Wrong

##### Question 1

**Question:** You need to create an alert when CPU usage exceeds 80% for 5 minutes. What should you configure? **Options:**

- A. Metric alert with 1-minute frequency and 5-minute window
- B. Log alert with 5-minute frequency
- C. Metric alert with 5-minute frequency and 5-minute window
- D. Activity log alert **Correct Answer:** A **Why I Got It Wrong:** Confused frequency with evaluation window **What to Remember:** Frequency is how often the rule runs, window is the time period evaluated

---

##### Question 2

**Question:** Which vault type should you use for Azure Database for PostgreSQL backup? **Options:**

- A. Recovery Services vault
- B. Azure Backup vault
- C. Key vault
- D. Storage account **Correct Answer:** B **Why I Got It Wrong:** Assumed Recovery Services vault handles all backups **What to Remember:** Azure Backup vault is for newer PaaS services like PostgreSQL, Blobs, and Disks

- Application Insights for web tier
- SQL database monitoring
- Network connectivity monitoring
- Alert notifications to operations team

---

#### Project Ideas
